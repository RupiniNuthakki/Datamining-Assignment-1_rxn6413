Facial  Expression Classification
There are two source files initial.ipynb and final.ipynb.
initial.ipynb file is the basic code where only 2 convolution layers are added.
After various experiments like no. of layers, no. of epochs, learning rate and Dropout changes are done.
Final accuracy got is 79.04% and loss got reduced which also reduces overfitting.

The ipynb files are to be executed in jupyter notebook
