Facial  Expression Classification : 

This is my attempt of implementing an image classifier of the Facial Emotion Expression dataset using Deep learning models such as CNN.
The dataset consists of both train and validation datasets where each have seven types of classes like angry, sad, neutral, disgust, fear, surprise, happy. 
The goal is to improve overall accuracy of all classes. 



Code:
There are two source files initial.ipynb and final.ipynb.
-> initial.ipynb file is the basic code where only 2 convolution layers are added.
-> After various experiments like no. of layers, no. of epochs, learning rate and Dropout changes are done.
->final.ipynb file is the final code which I got somewt]hat betetr accuracy.
-> Final accuracy acquired is 79.04% and loss got reduced which also reduces overfitting.


How to run:
The ipynb files are to be executed in jupyter notebook 
Datasets is from kaggle  https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/samaneheslamifar/facial-emotion-expressions
